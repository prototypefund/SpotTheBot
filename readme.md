## About the Project

![Screenshot](images/screenshot_game.png)

Spot The Bot allows communities to input their authentic texts and then challenges players to differentiate between these and AI-generated versions of the texts. Players tag suspicious words or phrases with custom labels such as "irrelevant" or "generic," aiding in the identification of AI-generated content and publishing helpful information even for those who prefer not to play the game. The game is designed to be community-agnostic, meaning that it can be tailored to any community, from online forums to social media platforms.

### Features
- **Community Customization:** Tailor the game to any community by inputting authentic, community-specific texts and adapting the style to the community's brand or CI.
- **Interactive Tagging Mechanism:** Engage with content by tagging suspicious words or phrases, learning to discern between AI and human language nuances.
- **Educational Tool:** Enhance critical reading skills and become more discerning of the content consumed online.
